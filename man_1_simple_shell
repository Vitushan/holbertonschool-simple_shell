.TH SHELL 1 "January 2025" "1.0" "Custom Shell"
.SH NAME
shell - A custom, simple UNIX command-line interpreter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shell
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B shell
is a basic command-line interpreter that provides functionality to execute commands in a UNIX environment. Designed as a learning project, it demonstrates key shell functionalities implemented manually.
.PP
Example:
.nf
$ ./shell
:) ls
file1.txt file2.c directory
:) exit
.fi
.SH FEATURES
The shell supports the following features:
.TP
.B 1. Command execution
Executes external programs found in the PATH or specified by an absolute or relative file path. It internally parses commands to identify valid executable paths.
.TP
.B 2. Built-in commands
Includes the following built-in commands:
.RS
.TP
.B cd [directory]
Changes the current working directory to the specified directory. If no argument is provided, it changes to the user's home directory. Supports cd -, cd .., and cd ~.
.TP
.B exit [status]
Exits the shell with the specified exit status. If no status is provided, the shell exits with the status of the last command executed.
.TP
.B env
Displays the current environment variables. The environment is managed using a custom implementation, as the shell does not rely on extern char **environ.

.SH USAGE
Upon starting, the shell presents a prompt where users can type commands. Commands can be simple (e.g., ls) or include arguments and options (e.g., ls -la).
.PP
Examples:
.nf
:) ls
:) cd /home
:) echo "Hello, world!"
:) ./custom_script.shell
.fi
.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell returns the exit status of the last command executed. If a command fails, it returns a non-zero value.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B /bin
Contains system binaries that can be executed by the shell.
.TP
.B /usr/bin
Additional system binaries.

.SH IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
This shell project avoids using certain standard features and functions such as extern char **environ. Instead, custom implementations were created for tokenization, path resolution, and environment variable management.
